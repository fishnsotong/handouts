\subsection*{Advection and mass transport}

When considering mass transport, we may have to take into account

\subsection*{Migration and diffusion} % is there a difference between migration and diffusion? maybe should just be diffusion

\textbf{Diffusion coefficient.} $$D = \frac{k_B T}{6 \pi \eta a}$$

where $a$ is the hydrodynamic radius, and $\eta$ is the viscosity coefficient.

Ions reach a terminal velocity when the electrical force applied on them is balanced
by drag due to solvent viscosity.

\textbf{Drift speed of ions in electric field.} The mobility $u$ of an ion decreases with increasing solution viscosity and ion size.
$$s = uE = \frac{ze}{6 \pi \eta a} E$$

The diffusion coefficient $D$ can be used to find $u$.
\begin{equation*}
    u = \frac{zeD}{k_B T}
\end{equation*}
