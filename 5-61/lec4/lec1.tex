\noindent
Lecture notes on the behaviour of light as a particle in addition to their wave characteristics. Photoelectric effect: light
comes in discrete packets (photons) with $E = h \nu$. Compton scattering: photons have definite momentum.

In equilibrium systems, the chemical potential of a substance is the same in every phase in which it occurs.
(How do we know this is the case?)

\section*{The utility of matrices}

The first half of this course deals with four \textit{exactly} solved problems.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Particle in a box
  \item Harmonic oscillator
  \item Rigid rotor
  \item Hydrogen atom
\end{itemize}

These problems are templates for a quantum mechanical understanding of reality. Thereafter, \textbf{perturbation theory} will 
show us how to use the patterns associated with these simple
problems to represent, decode, and understand reality.

$$\Delta p_A = p_A - p^{*}_{A} = -x_B p^*_A$$

Where $x_B$ is the\dots

\section*{Freezing Point Depression}

\section*{Osmotic Pressure}

Here we derive a relation between the osmotic pressure and the molar concentration of solute.

\begin{equation}
    \Pi V = RT n_B
\end{equation}

This is the van 't Hoff equation for osmotic pressure. It bears striking resemblance to the ideal gas law. \marginnote{Not to be confused for the relation that describes the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant, $K$.}
Replacing $\ce{[B]} = n_B / V$, we get the osmotic pressure relation:

\begin{equation}
    \Pi = \ce{[B]}RT
\end{equation}

This relation is valid only for ideal solutions.

\section{Electrochemistry Dump}
\textbf{Half-cell reactions.} Overall reaction can be conceived as two entirely separate reactions,
occurring at each electrode.

\begin{theorem}[Nernst Equation] Allows us to relate cell potential to the actual concentration of species
  present and the standard reduction potential ($E^\standardstate$).
  \begin{equation*}
    E = E^\standardstate - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q = E^\standardstate - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln\left(\frac{\alpha_B}{\alpha_A}\right)
\end{equation*}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose that the conventional cell reaction has the following general form
  \begin{equation*}
    \ce{aA + bB -> pP + qQ}.
  \end{equation*}

  $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}}G$ can be written in terms of individual chemical potentials.
  \begin{equation*}
    \Delta_{\mathrm{r}}G = p\mu_P + q\mu_Q - a\mu_A - b\mu_B
  \end{equation*}
  (of course, this is at standard state; above equation needs to change)
\end{proof}
  
\end{theorem}

Spectra are not born with assignments on them!

\section{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Alkyl-metal and aryl-metal complexes are thermodynamically stable, but kinetically labile.
  \item $\beta$-hydrogen elimination 
  \item These processes are essentially in a number of catalytic processes, such as alkene polymerisation, cross-couplings and hydroformylations.
  \item Also, they are key intermediates in \textbf{\ce{C-H} activation} processes. The transformation of unfunctionalised alkanes and arenes is one of the most active areas of research in the past twenty years \cite{guillemard2021late}.
\end{itemize}
