\section{Capacitance}

Capacitance ($C$). Describes the ability of an object to store charge.
$$Q = -C \Delta E = -\left(\frac{\epsilon A}{L}\right) \Delta E$$

For example, a dielectric material can be polarised: dipoles can align in an electric field
but charges cannot move. \\

The energy in a capacitor is
\begin{equation*}
    U = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0 E^2.
\end{equation*}

The electric field is where the potential energy put into a capacitor is stored.
