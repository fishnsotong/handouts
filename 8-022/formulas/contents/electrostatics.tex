Electric charge, which can be positive or negative, is both \textit{conserved} and \textit{quantised}.

\subsection*{Coulomb's law}
The force between two charges is
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1q_2}{r_{21}}
\end{equation*}
\textit{Superposition.} The force with which two charges interact is not changed by the presence of a third charge. 
Integrating this force, the \textit{potential energy} (work done in moving the charges from infinity) is
\begin{equation*}
  U = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1q_2\hat{\mathbf{r}_{21}}}{r^2_{21}}
\end{equation*}
For a system of many charges,
\begin{equation*}
  U = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\sum_{k \neq j}^{} \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_j q_k}{r_jk}
\end{equation*}
\subsection*{Electric field}
The \textit{electric field} due to a charge distribution is
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \frac{q_j\hat{\mathbf{r}}_j}{r^2_j}
\end{equation*}
I need to write more about what good this electric field does for us. \\
The force on a test charge $q$ is $\mathbf{F} = q \mathbf{E}$.
\subsection*{Flux}
Flux is defined as the surface integral of the perpendicular component of a vector field over a surface. 
\begin{equation*}
  \Phi = \int_S \mathbf{E} \cdot \differential \mathbf{a}
\end{equation*}
Mathematically, $\Phi_E$ is the integral of the normal component of the electric field over a given area. 
Conceptually, $\Phi_E$ is the `amount of field lines' passing through a given area.

\subsection*{Gauss' law}
Flux of $\mathbf{E}$ through any closed surface equals $1/\epsilon_0$ times total charge enclosed
by the surface.
\begin{equation*}
  \int_S \mathbf{E} \cdot \differential \mathbf{a} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \int p \differential v
\end{equation*}
For a sphere:
\begin{equation*}
  E = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}
\end{equation*}
For a line (what is $\lambda$?):
\begin{equation*}
  E = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0r}
\end{equation*}
For a sheet:
\begin{equation*}
  E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}
\end{equation*}

Gauss' law is always valid, but it is only useful in calculating $\mathbf{E}$ in cases with enough symmetry.
