\subsection*{Fermi's Golden Rule}
$$k(\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = \frac{2\pi}{h}|S(f,i)|^2V^2$$

\textbf{Frank-Condon Factor}: The square of the electric dipole transition moment.
$$|S(f,i)|^2 = \left( \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}\phi_i\phi_f \mathrm{d}x \right)^2$$
\subsection*{Light Absorption}
Beer Lambert Law: $A = \epsilon cl$

Oscillator Strength: oh dear god

\subsection*{Light Emission}
Quantum Yield:
$$\mathbf{\Phi}_F = \frac{k_R}{k_R + k_{IC} + k_{ISC}} = \frac{k_R}{k_0} = \frac{\tau_0}{\tau_R}$$

\section{Bimolecular Photochemistry}
Fermi's Golden Rule
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\phi_{F}}{\phi_{F}'} = \frac{\tau_0}{\tau} = \frac{k_0 + k_Q[Q]}{k_0}
\end{equation*}
\section{FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer}
A donor chromophore, initially in its electronic excited state, may transfer energy to an acceptor chromophore 
through non-radiative dipole-dipole coupling. \\

Dipole-dipole coupling:
$$E = \frac{1}{1 + (r/R_0)^6}$$

The efficiency of this energy transfer is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance between donor 
and acceptor, making FRET extremely sensitive to small changes in distance.
