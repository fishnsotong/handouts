\subsection*{Dot product}

Geometrically, $A \cdot B = |A| |B| \cos \theta$.

The dot product is computed as follows for an $N$-dimensional vector

\begin{equation*}
  A \cdot B = \sum_{i}^{N} a_i b_i
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{Cross product}

Geometrically, $A \times B = |A| |B| \sin \theta$.

The cross product is computed as follows

\begin{equation*}
  A \times B = \begin{vmatrix} \hat{i} & \hat{j} & \hat{k} \\ a_i & a_j & a_k \\ b_i  & b_j & b_k\end{vmatrix}
\end{equation*}
to give us a 3-vector.

\subsection*{Matrix Inverse}
Regular trig functions are `circular' functions. If $u = \cos(x)$ and $v = \sin(x)$, then $u^2 + v^2 = 1$, which is the equation of a unit circle.
