\section{Fluorescence Spectroscopy}

\textbf{Fluorescence lifetime.}

Differential Rate Law:
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}[\ce{S}_1]}{\mathrm{d}t} = -(k_R +k_{IC} +k_{ISC}) [\ce{S}_1]$$

Integrated Rate Law:
$$[\ce{S}_1]_t = [\ce{S}_1]_0 \exp[-(k_R + k_{IC} + k_{ISC})t]$$


\textbf{Fluorescence quantum yield.} Defined as ratio between rate of radiative decay and non-radiative decay.
$$\mathbf{\Phi}_F = \frac{k_R}{k_R + k_{IC} + k_{ISC}} = \frac{k_R}{k_0} = \frac{\tau_0}{\tau_R}$$

\subsection*{FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer}
1. Significant overlap of the absorption / emission spectrum of two molecules. \\
2. Both molecules are in close proximity. \\
FRET is efficient \textbf{non-radiative energy transfer} from the donor to the acceptor.

FRET energy transfer efficiency:
$$\phi_{\ce{FRET}} = \frac{k_{\ce{FRET}}}{k_{\ce{FRET}}+k_0} = \frac{R_0^6}{R_0^6+R_{DA}^6}$$

where $R_{DA}$ is the distance between donor and acceptor, 
$$k_{\ce{FRET}} = k_0 \left( \frac{R_0}{R_{DA}} \right)^6$$

and $R_0$ is defined such that $R_{DA} = R_0$, $k_{FRET} = k_0.$ The rate of FRET is equal that of other photophysical processes, energy transfer efficiency $\phi_{FRET} = 0.5$

FRET is extremely sensitive to small changes in distance ($1/R^6$).
